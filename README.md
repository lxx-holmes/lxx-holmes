This is Susie Xiaoxu Li.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently earning my MSc in Computer Science degree at HKU.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on a dissertation on NLP.

âš¡ Fun fact: I am an HKICPA, CICPA member and a CFA charter holder. 
I play the Pipa (a traditional Chinese instrument) and the piano, and was in the school orchestra from primary school through to university.

ðŸ’¬ I am keen to explore how technology will change the finance industry.
